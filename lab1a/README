Including files:
lab1a.c:
Contains source code of a character-at-a-time, no-echo mode
terminal. After compile, run with --shell option will bring
the user to the shell mode. When --shell option applied, the
program will change the current terminal arguments to a new
setting, then fork a new process as child process, then run
shell by execvp() in child process. The communication between
parent process and child process are based on two pipes, and
also has corresponding poll() function to avoid conflict during
data transaction between parent process and child process.
When the program receive ^C or ^D from keyboard, the program 
will exit with corresponding exit code.

Exit codes:
0 ... normal execution, shutdown on ^D
1 ... unrecognized argument or system call failure


Makefile:
A simple make file that include compile, clean and tar features.
