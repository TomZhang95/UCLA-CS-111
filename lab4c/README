Files Included:
- lab4c_tcp.c:
Contains the source code which implements the temperature sensor and the button. There
are 3 command line arguments: --id=number --host=address_or_name --log=FILENAME. Which 
will establish a TCP connect to host, and sending/receiving data with host

- lab4c_tls.c:
Same features as lab4c_tcp.c, but using authenticated TLS session encryption instead of 
non-encrypted TCP connection, which is more secure, but need to use OpenSSL library.

Makefile:
Contains a simple make option, which build the source file to a executable file called
lab4c; 
a check option, which execute an automated smoke-test of the lab4c to see 
if it runs and can talk to its sensors/actuators; 
a clean option, which delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile;
a dist option, which create the deliverable tarball.
