git.png:
The screen shot of using 'git clone' command to cloned one of my repository
in my github. Before doing clone, I first generated a key pair in the board
and added the public key to my github account, otherwise the clone would
be denied by 'no authorition'. The command I used are follow:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "1050248157@qq.com"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa
